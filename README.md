# FastHabbit 

This is a fasting tracker app aimed at people who need something a bit different from conventional fasting tracker apps or methods.

## Description
FastHabbit incorporates gamification and social elements as a way of increasing user motivation, so they can maintain their fasting habit.

A nature motif is used throughout the app to bring a sense of calm and familiarity to the user.

With each fast, the user chooses which type of flower they would like to grow and upon completion, this flower is 'harvested' and is visible in the garden.

However, as the goal is to increase habit consistency rather than perfection, all recorded fasts, whether incomplete or complete, are displayed in the garden. This is to remind the user of the journey they have endured so far.
